  <section class="about">
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p> I am a Master’s student in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zürich, passionate about Robotics, Systems and Control. I am driven by challenging research questions in this field and the opportunity to make a positive impact on people’s lives. Currently, I am developing a digital twin of an operating room to enable seamless evaluation of surgeon training. In this project, I explore human pose estimation and state estimation. I am also an assistant on the organising team of the Robotics Summer School, conducted by RobotX at ETH Zurich.</p>
    <p> I completed my Bachelor’s degree at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, where I graduated at the top of my class and won the best thesis award. During my time there, I developed a speed-control submodule, an autonomous system on ROS, and a prototype of a compliant hand exoskeleton.</p>

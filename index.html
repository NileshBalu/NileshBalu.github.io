    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hello! I am Nilesh Balu, an incoming MSc student at ETH Zurich, pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering. My academic interests lie primarily in the fields of Robotics, Systems, and Controls. Currently, I am looking forward to deepening my knowledge in Microrobotics and other advanced robotics topics during my studies.</p>
    <p>Throughout my academic career, I have been passionate about combining practical engineering with impactful applications. I developed an autonomous electric wheelchair prototype during my research internship at Ontario Tech University in 2023, where I worked with ROS to create a functional and efficient assistive device.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I have worked on projects such as an assistive hand exoskeleton during my undergraduate assistantship, which was recognized as the best B.Tech project in my department. My interests also extend to rehabilitation and medical robotics, where I aim to contribute to improving human well-being through innovative technologies.</p>

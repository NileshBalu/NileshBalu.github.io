    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p> I am a Master’s student in the Mechanical Engineering Department at <em>Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zürich</em>, passionate about robotics. I am driven by challenging research questions in this field and the opportunity to make a positive impact on people’s lives.</p>
    <p> Currently, I am working with the <em>Product Development Group Zurich</em>, to develop a digital twin of an operating room to enable seamless evaluation of surgeon training. In this project, I explore <em>human pose estimation</em> and <em>state estimation</em>. Additionally, I am a student assistant on the organizing team of the <em>Robotics Summer School</em>, conducted by <em>RobotX</em> at ETH Zurich.</p>
    <p> I completed my Bachelor’s degree at the <em>Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras</em>, where I graduated at the top of my class and won the <em>Best Thesis Award</em>. During my time there, I developed a speed-control submodule, an autonomous system using ROS, and a prototype of a compliant hand exoskeleton.</p>

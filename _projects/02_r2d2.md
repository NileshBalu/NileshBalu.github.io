**Aim:** 

Develop a community device that is accessible to both able-bodied individuals and wheelchair users, particularly those with paraplegia.

**Summary:**

I developed the electronics module for a proof-of-concept prototype, building upon an existing mechanical system. This project focused on enhancing usability, control, and data accessibility, making the device more functional and user-friendly.

We implemented a wireless throttle to control the speed of the device, allowing for seamless transitions of the modes of operation. We also designed an intuitive start-up mechanism that eliminates the need for complex manual inputs, ensuring a smoother user experience.

Additionally, I created a real-time data logging system that transmits key performance metrics wirelessly, enabling remote monitoring and analysis for performance evaluation and debugging.

I also engineered a custom locking mechanism to enhance safety and stability, ensuring smooth transitions between different operational modes.

**Takeaways:**

This was my first mechatronics system development project, and it was a continuous learning experience. My skill set grew significantly over the course of this internship. I gained hands-on experience with soldering wires and perf boards, implementing digital PID control on a motor, designing mechanisms for switching between different modes of operation and 3D printing. Additionally, I became a more proficient Arduino programmer.

<strong>Aim:</strong></p>

<p>Develop a numerical solver to solve the <em>convection-diffusion</em> equation for fluid flow in a pipe. Analyse the effect of adding annular fins to the pipe and varying its parameters.</p>

<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>

<p>The governing equations are solved in the axisymmetric coordinate system. The discretisation is performed using the upward differencing scheme (UDS), and the system of equations is solved using the line-by-line tri-diagonal matrix algorithm (TDMA).</p>

<p>The solver was validated by comparing the temperature profile of the first fin along its length with analytical solutions. The fluidâ€™s mean temperature along the pipeâ€™s length was also compared with analytical solutions for validation.</p>

<p>The parameters of the fin, viz. fin length, thickness and spacing, are varied, and their effects on the finâ€™s effectiveness are analysed. It is observed that the fin effectiveness increases as each of these parameters is increased.</p>
